# Colors

Colors is a Kotlin library for changing the style of a string.

Colors has no dependencies (besides kotlin stdlib)

## Installing

Still is not in bintray. So wait for it.

## Usage

### Setting a default color

The library supports the colors defined per ANSI 3/4 bit colors. For changing to a specific color simply call it!

```kotlin
"This is black".black()
"This is red".red()
"This is blue".blue()
...
```

If more than one is specified, it will use the last one.
```kotlin
"This is blue".red().green().blue()
```

### Background and foreground colors

If you with to set background or foreground colors just:
```kotlin
"With red background".background(Colors.Color.RED)
"With red foreground".foreground(Colors.Color.RED)
"With red foreground".red()
```

### Setting modes

```kotlin
"Underlined".underline()
"Italic".italic()
"Bold".bold()
...
```

### Chaining

```kotlin
"What should this be?".red().italic().bold().strikethrough()
```

### Creating customs
```kotlin
"Some red in italics".colorize(color = Colors.Color.RED, mode = Colors.Mode.ITALIC)
```
